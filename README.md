# Short-Term-Precipitation-Forecasting-Based-on-Radar-Reflectivity-Images

This repository describes the image pre-processing and feature extraction stage of a framework that predicts short-term precipitation at Hong Kong based on radar reflectivity images. This framework utilizes cloud trajectory method based on velocity vector obtained by the SIFT algorithm which matches descriptors in the adjacent time frames. Features including statistics of radar images and global descriptions of cloud pattern are selected as the input of a convolutional neural network.
